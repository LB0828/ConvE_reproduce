ConvE is CNN-based model for knowlege graph Embedding, author's code implement is by spodernet which is hard understand.

We reproduce ConvE by pytorch without spodernet. It will be convenient for other researchers who are not familiar with the spodernet lib.

- If you want to implement yourself, you can refer https://github.com/TimDettmers/ConvE/issues/32.
